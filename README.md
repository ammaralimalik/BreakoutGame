# CSIS225-FinalProject
This project was created as part of my final project for my CSIS-225 course.

Run and compile the PongGame.java file to run the program,
After starting up the program depending on what player number you are the text on top will introduce what player number you are.
There is a leaderboard text in the middle of the screen showcasing the players which have survived the longest.

The main goal of the game is to keep the ball in play as long as you are able to using the mouse to move the bottom paddle., the ball also has a random x+ direction to act as an extra challenge.
There are powerups which are red; increases speed, blue; changes the balls colors randomly and green; decreases the speed of the ball.
